Welcome to the Thousand Parsec Enlightened Client!

This is client for Thousand Parsec.  The home page for that project is at
http://www.thousandparsec.com/.  Please, if you find the 's', let us know.

This client uses the E foundation libraries, in particular Edje, Evas and
Ecore.

Additional it supports an AI infrastructure, and a simple AI for the game
minisec 'Smith'. 

About Smith
===========

Smith is a purely reaction driven AI.  It essentially only reacts to finding
things it can give orders too.  In fact it only orders Frigates and Planets at
this time.   For Frigates it finds them somewhere to colonise.  For planets,
it gets them to build frigates. 

There is basic support for redirecting fleets which are going to colonise
pre-colonised worlds.

Future Work
===========

The main piece of future work is to complete the human UI.  Once that is done
tp04 support, and support for other rulesets.  Hopefully it will keep pace
with the SoC projects.
