INSTALL
=======

The Thousand Parsec Enlightened Client (tpe) depends on the Enlightenment
Foundation Libraries.  In particular Ecore, Evas, and Edje.  

There are two ways of getting the libraries: 
 * Download from CVS from enlightenment.org
 * Download unofficial packages for your distribution

Unofficial packages are available at:
deb http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu edgy e17
deb-src http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu edgy e17

Or use
## E17 repository "edevelop.org"
deb http://edevelop.org/pkg-e/ubuntu edgy e17
deb-src http://edevelop.org/pkg-e/ubuntu edgy e17


Replace edgy with one of dapper or feisty if you prefer.

apt-get install libevas1-loaders-all libewl1-engines-all		\
	libevas1-all libewl1-dev libecore1-con-dev libecore1-job-dev	\
	libecore1-evas-dev edje0-bin

Should get you the libraries you need.

Then just 'make' in this directory.
