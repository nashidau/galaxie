 * Orders
 	- Display
	- Enter
 * New art for:

 * Colour coded fleets
 * AI Improvements:
	 - Settle locally 
	 	- If parent is the same - colonise it first, even if something
			is on route
	- Handle ships being destroyed (so send someone else)
	- If someone settles in the same system - nail them!
		- Build 4 warships and hit them
	- Occasionally build some warships to attack planets
	- When nothing left to settle, build fleets to attack places.
	- Option to limit growth rate
	- Recover from being shut down
		- Find ships with colonisation orders
